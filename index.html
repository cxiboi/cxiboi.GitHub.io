Traditional studies of decision making involve presenting a tightly circumscribed set of options (press button A or button B; choose the most attractive of four faces). However, real- world decisions are less constrained. For example, in the supermarket we may face an array of thousands of potential options, and there is no way that we could feasibly weigh up the pros and cons of each before making a choice. Attention plays a critical role here by prioritizing some candidate items and deprioritizing others, dramatically narrowing the pool of options under consideration.
Contemporary models characterize the role of attention in choice within the sequential sampling framework (e.g., Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993; Cavanagh et al., 2014; Krajbich, 2019; Krajbich et al., 2010; Newell, 2005; Newell & Le Pelley, 2018; Sepulveda et al., 2020; Smith & Krajbich, 2019). These models specify a casual influence of attention on choice: the more attention an option receives, the more rapidly evidence accumulates in support of that option. On this view, to gain a full understanding of why we choose some options over others, we must understand why we attend to some options over others.
Clearly, goal-driven processes are an important determinant of attention (see Yantis, 2000) and will influence choice (Callaway et al., 2021; Sepulveda et al., 2020): if we have gone to the supermarket to buy milk, we will tend to prioritize the dairy section, and white items, and cartons etc.
Likewise attention can be shaped by the physical salience of stimuli; that is, how distinctive items are relative to their surroundings (Theeuwes, 1992). Even if we are in the supermarket to buy milk, our attention may be captured by a brightly colored sign advertising that detergent is on sale, in turn increasing the likelihood that we choose to buy detergent (Towal et al., 2013; Vanunu et al., 2021).
More recent research suggests a further class of influences on attention that relate to our previous experience with stimuli, independently of our current goals and the physical features of those stimuli (Failing & Theeuwes, 2018; Theeuwes, 2019; Watson et al., 2019b). In the current study, we investigate whether two of these experience-related influences on attention—relating to reward learning and memory—can also modulate and bias decision-making behavior. This is a critical issue, because it is our choices that ultimately determine our interaction with the world.
